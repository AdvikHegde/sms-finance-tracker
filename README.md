Goal : Build a MERN app that reads bank SMS from my Android phone, parses transactions, stores them, and visualizes personal spending.

Core features:

Read bank SMS (Android)
Parse transaction data
Store transactions
Dashboard + analytics
Category management



Technologies used inside of this project that need to be understood in more detail
JWT's and ZOD (used for data-validation)

Note : the .env file will always be searched for inside the current directory, if it doesnt find it, then that will raise not found error
